# PyBuild-dep

PyBuild-dep is a bash script using pipreqs to construct a requirement.txt with import from all ".py" files in a project.
It will look recursively for ".py" files in the specified project directory.
It will exclude all ".py" files contained in "venv" directory.

The goal of the script it's to help you maintain a clean requirements, it's not a magic script, nor perfect.
Always check the result.
